20800,"Specter of Trump Loosens Tongues, if Not Purse Strings, in Silicon Valley - The New York Times",David Streitfeld,"PALO ALTO, Calif.  —   After years of scorning the political process, Silicon Valley has leapt into the fray. The prospect of a President Donald J. Trump is pushing the tech community to move beyond its traditional role as donors and to embrace a new existence as agitators and activists. A distinguished venture capital firm emblazoned on its corporate home page an earthy   epithet. One prominent tech chieftain says the consequences of Mr. Trump’s election would “range between disastrous and terrible. ” Another compares him to a dictator. And nearly 150 tech leaders signed an open letter decrying Mr. Trump and his campaign of “anger” and “bigotry. ” Not quite all the action is  . Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal and Palantir who was the first outside investor in Facebook, spoke at the Republican convention in July. The New York Times reported on Saturday that Mr. Thiel is giving $1. 25 million to support Mr. Trump’s candidacy even as other supporters flee. (He also recently gave $1 million to a “super PAC” that supports Senator Rob Portman, the Republican freshman running for   in Ohio.) Getting involved in politics used to be seen as clashing with Silicon Valley’s value system: You transform the world by making problems obsolete, not solving them through Washington. Nor did entrepreneurs want to alienate whatever segment of customers did not agree with them politically. Such reticence is no longer in style here. “We’re a bunch of nerds not used to having a lot of limelight,” said Dave McClure, an investor who runs a tech incubator called 500 Startups. “But to quote   ‘With great power comes great responsibility. ’” Mr. McClure grew worried after the Republican and Democratic conventions as Mr. Trump began to catch up to Hillary Clinton in the polls. He wanted Silicon Valley to do more, and so late last month he announced Nerdz4Hillary, an informal   effort. An initial group of donors pledged $50, 000 the goal was to ask the “nerdz” for small donations to match that sum. They have not come through yet. “We’re kind of optimistic we’ll get the other $50, 000 in a few weeks,” Mr. McClure said. That relatively slow pace reflects Silicon Valley’s shifting position: Even as it becomes increasingly free with its opinions, it has been less free with its checkbook. The most recent data, from late August, shows Mrs. Clinton taking in $7. 7 million from the tech community, according to Crowdpac, a   that tracks donations. By that point in 2012, Crowdpac says, President Obama had raised $21 million from entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. Reid Hoffman, the billionaire   of the business networking site LinkedIn, offers a snapshot of Silicon Valley’s evolving approach to politics. Mr. Hoffman was a top Obama donor, giving $1 million to the Priorities USA political action committee, something several of his peers did as well. Last month, Mr. Hoffman garnered worldwide publicity for saying he would donate up to $5 million to veterans’ groups if Mr. Trump released his taxes, a remote possibility that never came to pass. He has castigated Mr. Trump in interviews, saying he was speaking for those who were afraid. Mr. Hoffman’s outright donations, however, have been smaller this election cycle. In May, he gave $400, 000 to the Hillary Victory Fund. Asked if there was more recent giving that had not shown up in federal election records, Mr. Hoffman cryptically responded in an email, “Looking at some PACs, etc. ” He declined several opportunities to elaborate. Even as Priorities USA has raised $133 million this election cycle, far exceeding its total in 2012, its tech contributions have dwindled. The only familiar tech name this time around is John Doerr of the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield  Byers, who gave $500, 000. The AOL   Steve Case said his September endorsement of Mrs. Clinton, via an   in The Washington Post, was the first time he ever publicly declared for a candidate. “I always focused on policy and avoided politics,” he said. “But if Trump were elected president, I would be disappointed in myself for not acting. ” When he wrote the   he was uncertain about donating money to Mrs. Clinton, saying only that it was “probable. ” A spokeswoman said Sunday that Mr. Case gave $25, 000 to the Hillary Victory Fund. Mason Harrison, Crowdpac’s head of communications, offered a possible reason for Mrs. Clinton’s    support. “Donors give to support candidates they love, not to defeat candidates they fear,” he said. A few billionaires are acting instead of talking. Dustin Moskovitz, a founder of Facebook, said he was giving $20 million to various Democratic election efforts  —   the first time he and his wife, Cari Tuna, have endorsed a candidate. He declined to be interviewed. Part of the problem for Mrs. Clinton is that, however preferable she may be to Mr. Trump in the tech community, she pales in comparison to President Obama. After some initial misgivings, Silicon Valley found its champion in him. There has been a revolving door between tech and the Obama administration, just as previous Democratic administrations had a revolving door with Wall Street. In June, President Obama seemed to suggest that he might become a venture capitalist after his term ends. Mrs. Clinton is not as enthusiastic toward Silicon Valley and its disruptive ways. In a speech in the summer of 2015, she noted that   in the “  or   gig economy”  —   Uber, Airbnb and their ilk  —   were “unleashing innovation” but also “raising hard questions about workplace protection and what a good job will look like in the future. ” The Clinton campaign declined to comment. The Trump campaign did not respond to a query. Even as Silicon Valley works against Mr. Trump, there is quiet acknowledgment that his campaign has bared some important issues. In an endorsement this month of Mrs. Clinton, the venture capital firm Union Square Ventures pointed out that “the benefits of technology and globalization have not been evenly distributed,” and that this needed to change. If Silicon Valley’s political involvement outlasts this unusual election, the tech community may start contributing more to the process than commentary and cash. “Not only are tech people going to be wielding influence, but they’re going to be the candidate,” Mr. McClure said. “Reid Hoffman, Sheryl Sandberg”  —   the chief operating officer of Facebook  —   “and a bunch of other folks here have political aspirations. ” Others may be inspired to enter politics through other doors. Palmer Luckey is the    founder of the Oculus virtual reality company, which he sold to Facebook for $2 billion. Mr. Luckey donated $10, 000 to a group dedicated to spreading    messages about Mrs. Clinton both online and off. The group’s first billboard, said to be outside Pittsburgh, labeled her “Too Big to Jail. ” Mr. Luckey told The Daily Beast that his thinking “went along the lines of, ‘Hey, I have a bunch of money. I would love to see more of this stuff. ’” He added, “I thought it sounded like a real jolly good time. ” Many virtual reality developers were less happy, and Mr. Luckey quickly posted his regrets on Facebook. He declined to comment further. “If we’re going to be more vocal, we’ll have to live more transparently,” said Hunter Walk, a venture capitalist whose campaign to persuade tech companies to give workers Election Day off signed up nearly 300 firms, including Spotify, SurveyMonkey and TaskRabbit. “There will be a period of adjustment. ” But perhaps being vocal is a temporary condition after all. The venture firm CRV was in the spotlight at the end of August with its blunt   message, which included the earthy epithet. A few weeks later, it cleaned up its website. The partners went from employing a publicist to seek out attention to declining interviews. “We reached everyone we wanted to reach, and hopefully influenced opinions,” said Saar Gur, a CRV venture capitalist. “Then the buzz died down and we went back to our day jobs, which are super busy. ”"

Be Sociable, Share! (Rob Wilson photo) 
Native American leaders vowed on Saturday to protest through the winter against a North Dakota oil pipeline they say threatens water resources and sacred lands and are planning lawsuits over police treatment of arrested protesters. 
Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II said he and other tribal leaders were working on providing food, heat and shelter for protesters opposed to the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline. 
“We’re just working through some technical details as far as where the land is, and the type of land that can be used for some permanent structures,” Archambault told reporters in Mandan, North Dakota on Saturday morning. 
At least 10 shelters were being readied on tribal land against temperatures that can fall below -35 Fahrenheit (-37 Celsius) for days at time, he said. 
“It doesn’t have to put our water at risk,” said Archambault, who was joined by Cheyenne River Sioux Chairman Harold Frazier. 
The two leaders said they’re considering taking legal action against law enforcement. Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault II said more than 40 people were injured, including broken bones and welts from rubber bullets and bean bag rounds fired by law enforcement on Thursday, Oct. 27th. 
Archambault said his tribe may pursue a class action over police tactics. Officers in riot gear swept through a protester camp on private land using pepper spray, bean bag rounds and an audio cannon aiming high-pitched “sound cannon” blasts against demonstrators. At least 142 people were arrested on Thursday and Friday. 
Protesters had numbers written on their arms and were housed in what appeared to be dog kennels, without bedding or furniture. 
“It’s just wrong to use that type of force on innocent people,” Archambault said Saturday, Oct. 29, during a press conference in front of the Morton County Sheriff’s Department. 
Cheyenne River Sioux Chairman Harold Frazier said he has heard reports of inhumane treatment while people were incarcerated. 
“All they’re doing is standing up to protect that water,” Frazier said. Here come reinforcements! As police attack & arrest land protectors thousands of buffalo storm #StandingRock https://t.co/NoQyIsWbxv #NoDAPL pic.twitter.com/oMa647HviB

Meanwhile, Amnesty International USA (AIUSA) announced that they are sending a delegation of human rights observers to monitor the response of law enforcement to the protests. 
AIUSA also has sent a letter to the Morton County Sheriff’s Department expressing concern about the degree of force used against the protests. The organization will also call on the Department of Justice to investigate police practices. 
AIUSA sent a delegation of observers to the area in August and has stayed in contact both with the Indigenous community and those policing the protests since then. Letters had previously been sent to the North Dakota Highway Patrol and the Morton County Sheriff’s office calling for law enforcement officers to respect international human rights standards on the policing of protests. 
“Our observers are here to ensure that everyone’s human rights are protected,” said Eric Ferrero, director of communications for AIUSA. “We’re deeply concerned about what we heard during our previous visit to Standing Rock and what has been reported to us since.” 
In some instances, police have responded to protesters with pepper spray and bean bags, and in one instance, private security staff used guard dogs. Those recently arrested have reported being strip searched and forced to pay bail for minor offenses. Members of the media and legal observers have also been arrested or charged with minor offenses. 
“People here just want to stand up for the rights of Indigenous people and protect their natural resources. These people should not be treated like the enemy,” said Ferrero “Police must keep the peace using minimal force appropriate to the situation. Confronting men, women, and children while outfitted in gear more suited for the battlefield is a disproportionate response.”
